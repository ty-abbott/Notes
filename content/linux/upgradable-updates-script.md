## Creating the script to alert me with updatable upgrades

- using apt list --upgradable to tell me what updates there are
- writing to a text file the output if there are updates that are returned 
- implement a bot account for emails with gmail
- add bot details as persistent environment variables through editing ~/.bashrc and then reloading through source ~/.bashrc
- test with echo $variable
