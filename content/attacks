## Kerberos and Kerberoasting 

### What is Kerberos? 

- Kerberos is a authentication method used in windows domains. 
- this is in playbooks by ransomware groups and this is a step THEY will take to see if they can get lateral movement to deploy malware 
- access will be obtained through phishing email, password spraying, access brokers, etc. 
- Anyone can request a ticket-granting ticket from the KDC(Key Distribution center) if pre-authentication is not enabled or users can also request tgs ticket 
- The request is in clear text and the resulting ticket is composed of two parts a session key that is encrypted with the hash of the users password and the TGT, which is encrypted with the session key 
- If the account's password is insecure, then an attacker can brute-force the password and then discover the session key and then use that to decrypt the TGT. All this can be done offline.
- If RC4 is being used then it is even quicker to crack these passwords, about 800 times faster. You can guess more passwords with rc4 
- by default the gpo for kerberos is undefined so this allows attackers to do a downgrade to encryption
- If the service account is using pre-authentication then TGS tickets are used and the process is very similar 
- if no preauthentication then TGT are used 
- 
- automated tools such as rubeus are very powerful with kerberos 

- krbtgt account needs to be changed twice - Why does KRBTGT need to be reset twice?
KRBTGT keeps a password history of 2, hence we reset it twice to invalidate all tickets issued from old KRBTGT password.
