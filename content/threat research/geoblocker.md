# The skinny on geoblocker 

I have decided to change up the scope of this projecct in a fairly signifigant way. No longer will it be a automatic IP blocker(for reasons I post on
the readme and ill post here in the future)but rather a drive by scanning informer(?). Going to gather intel on the IPs that are constantly scanning the internet. 
Why? Because I am curious...
