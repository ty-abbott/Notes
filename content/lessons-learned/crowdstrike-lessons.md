- Perhaps on the enterprise level auto pushed updates is less favored then manual push via patching solution. Dont auto push updates on production networks. 

- Have a backup plan for endpoints that can roll back to a different image. The backup server shouldnt have the same stack as the other affected machines nor should it have auto updates. Essentially if your backup server is also blue screened then that doesnt do much good. Multiple backup sites with different vendors. 

- this is a good way to assess a companies disaster recovery. How quickly can they be up and running after things go down. 

- Recovery Key management is important!!
